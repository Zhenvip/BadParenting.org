      "I think this is one of the best games I have ever played. Even though many people can tell the graphics or textures are “bad” the story is just too good. It shows a reality many people around all the world lives. The things that are really scary, are not ghosts, demons and that kind of stuff, is real people like Mr. Red Face. Poor Ron and the other kids, they did not deserve that end :). I hope the creator develop a part 2 of this piece of art.",

      "Pretty good game！Wow, this game blew me away! At first, I was skeptical about the dated graphics, but man, the atmosphere is just unreal. The way it builds tension without relying on cheap jump scares is masterful. The story had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and that ending... just gut-wrenching. It's not often a game sticks with you like this. Definitely a hidden gem in the indie horror scene.",

      "I stumbled upon this game during a late-night Twitch stream and had to try it myself. Boy, am I glad I did! The atmosphere is thick enough to cut with a knife, and the puzzles are actually challenging without being frustrating. It's rare to find a horror game that respects the player's intelligence like this. My only gripe is that it's a bit short, but quality over quantity, right? Fingers crossed for a sequel!",

      "I've played my fair share of horror games, but this one hits different. The low-poly look actually adds to the creepy vibe, kinda like those old PS1 classics. But it's the sound design that really shines - those ambient noises had me constantly looking over my shoulder. The plot twists caught me off guard, and I'm still trying to piece together all the clues. Can't wait for a sequel or DLC!.",
